## üéØ **Complete 7-Step Pipeline Execution**

### **Step 1: Generate Difficulty Categories** (Sonnet 3.5 v2)
```json
{
  "Beginner": [
    "Understanding what DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) is and its basic purpose",
    "Introduction to preference data collection and annotation",
    "Basic comparison between DPO and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)"
  ],
  "Intermediate": [
    "Implementation of DPO loss function and training objectives",
    "Hyperparameter tuning for DPO training",
    "Techniques for preference data quality assessment and filtering"
  ],
  "Advanced": [
    "Mathematical foundations of DPO and its connection to reward modeling",
    "Custom architectures for efficient DPO training at scale",
    "Hybrid approaches combining DPO with other alignment techniques"
  ]
}
```

### **Step 2: Generate Error Catalog** (Sonnet 3.5 v2)
**6 Key Error Patterns Identified**:
1. **Using raw logits instead of log probabilities in DPO loss calculation**
   - Impact: Model fails to learn proper preference alignment
   - Likelihood: 90% strong models avoid, 70% weak models make

2. **Incorrect reference model handling in loss computation**
   - Impact: Unstable training, model diverges too aggressively  
   - Likelihood: 85% strong models avoid, 80% weak models make

3. **Missing temperature scaling in preference logits**
   - Impact: Over-optimization on preferences, loss of capabilities
   - Likelihood: 80% strong models avoid, 60% weak models make

4. **Improper batch normalization of preference pairs**
   - Impact: Inconsistent learning across batches
   - Likelihood: 75% strong models avoid, 65% weak models make

5. **Not handling edge cases in preference data**
   - Impact: Poor handling of nuanced preferences  
   - Likelihood: 85% strong models avoid, 75% weak models make

6. **Incorrect gradient clipping strategy**
   - Impact: Training instability, slow convergence
   - Likelihood: 80% strong models avoid, 70% weak models make

### **Step 3: Generate Strategic Implementation Challenge** (Sonnet 3.5 v2)
```json
{
  "title": "Implement DPO Training for Customer Service Response Generation",
  "question_text": "Implement a DPO loss function and training loop to fine-tune a language model on customer service response preferences. Given pairs of responses (chosen vs rejected) for customer inquiries, train the model to generate more appropriate responses according to company guidelines.",
  "context": "An e-commerce company wants to improve their AI customer service responses by fine-tuning their base LLM using human agent preferences. They have collected 50,000 pairs of responses where human agents selected better vs worse responses for real customer inquiries.",
  "requirements": [
    "Implement DPO loss calculation comparing chosen vs rejected response probabilities",
    "Set up proper reference model handling with frozen weights and detached computation", 
    "Implement temperature scaling for preference logits with a configurable beta parameter",
    "Create training loop that processes batches of (prompt, chosen, rejected) examples",
    "Add logging for loss components and preference probability distributions"
  ],
  "success_criteria": "The implementation should show stable training dynamics with KL divergence staying within reasonable bounds (0.1-2.0). The preference gap between chosen/rejected responses should increase during training while maintaining response fluency."
}
```

### **Step 4: Mid-Tier Model Implementation** (Haiku 3.5) ‚úÖ
**Key Strengths**:
- ‚úÖ **Proper log probability handling** vs raw logits
- ‚úÖ **Correct reference model freezing** and gradient detachment  
- ‚úÖ **Proper temperature scaling** implementation
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** and metrics tracking
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready features** like wandb integration
- ‚úÖ **Clean code architecture** with separation of concerns

**Sample Code (Correct Implementation)**:
```python
def compute_dpo_loss(self, batch):
    # Proper log probability computation
    chosen_logps = self._compute_log_probs(prompts, chosen_responses)
    rejected_logps = self._compute_log_probs(prompts, rejected_responses)
    
    # Reference model with proper detachment
    with torch.no_grad():
        ref_chosen_logps = self._compute_ref_log_probs(prompts, chosen_responses)
        ref_rejected_logps = self._compute_ref_log_probs(prompts, rejected_responses)
    
    # Correct temperature scaling and loss
    chosen_logratios = chosen_logps - ref_chosen_logps
    rejected_logratios = rejected_logps - ref_rejected_logps
    logits = chosen_logratios - rejected_logratios
    losses = -torch.nn.functional.logsigmoid(self.beta * logits)
```

### **Step 5: Weak-Tier Model Implementation** (Haiku 3) ‚ùå
**Key Failures** (All 6 Error Patterns Hit):
- ‚ùå **Raw softmax probabilities** instead of log probabilities
- ‚ùå **Incorrect gather()** on probabilities vs proper log computation  
- ‚ùå **Wrong temperature scaling** (applies after softmax)
- ‚ùå **Oversimplified KL divergence** calculation 
- ‚ùå **Missing batch masking** for variable sequences
- ‚ùå **No proper logging** infrastructure

**Sample Code (Problematic Implementation)**:
```python
def compute_dpo_loss(self, prompts, chosen_responses, rejected_responses):
    # WRONG: Raw softmax instead of log probabilities
    chosen_probs = torch.softmax(chosen_logits, dim=-1)
    rejected_probs = torch.softmax(rejected_logits, dim=-1)
    
    # WRONG: Temperature scaling after softmax
    chosen_logits = chosen_logits / self.beta
    
    # WRONG: Gather on probabilities instead of log space
    dpo_loss = -torch.log(chosen_probs.gather(1, chosen_responses.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze())
```

### **Step 6: Judge Differentiation** (Sonnet 3.5 v2) ‚úÖ
**Judgment Result**: **DIFFERENTIATION_ACHIEVED: YES** | **Quality Score: 8/10**

**Analysis**:
- **Clear expertise gap**: Implementation A shows deep understanding of DPO training dynamics
- **Multiple failure points**: Implementation B falls into 6 known error patterns
- **Domain-specific differentiation**: Requires both theoretical and practical DPO knowledge
- **Production relevance**: Errors would cause real training instability issues

**Specific Weak Model Failures Identified**:
1. Uses raw softmax probabilities instead of log probabilities for DPO loss
2. Implements gather() on probabilities instead of proper log probability computation
3. Incorrect temperature scaling implementation (applies after softmax)
4. Oversimplified KL divergence calculation that may lead to training instability
5. Missing proper batch masking for variable length sequences
6. No proper logging of preference probability distributions

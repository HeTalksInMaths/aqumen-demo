Your task is to analyze incoming customer messages and return structured JSON output that will be stored in a database. Follow the format requirements exactly.\n\n**OUTPUT SCHEMA REQUIREMENTS:**\nReturn a valid JSON object with these exact fields and constraints:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message_id\": \"string (auto-generated UUID format)\",\n  \"sentiment\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: positive, negative, neutral, mixed)\",\n  \"priority\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: low, medium, high, critical)\",\n  \"category\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: bug_report, feature_request, complaint, inquiry, billing, technical_support)\",\n  \"department\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: engineering, product, customer_success, billing, sales)\",\n  \"confidence_score\": \"number (0.0 to 1.0, two decimal places)\",\n  \"issues\": \"array of objects with structure: [{\\\"type\\\": \\\"string\\\", \\\"description\\\": \\\"string\\\", \\\"severity\\\": \\\"string (low/medium/high)\\\"}]\",\n  \"keywords\": \"array of strings (3-8 relevant terms)\",\n  \"customer_impact\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: none, low, medium, high)\",\n  \"requires_immediate_attention\": \"boolean\",\n  \"suggested_response_time\": \"string (EXACTLY one of: 1_hour, 4_hours, 24_hours, 72_hours)\"\n}\n```\n\n**ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. Determine sentiment by analyzing tone, language, and emotional indicators\n2. Assign priority based on business impact, urgency signals, and customer language intensity\n3. Route to appropriate department based on issue type and required expertise\n4. Extract 1-5 distinct issues, even if message contains multiple problems\n5. Set confidence_score based on message clarity and your certainty in classifications\n\n**EDGE CASE HANDLING:**\n- If sentiment is unclear: use \"neutral\"\n- If multiple departments could handle: choose primary department based on main issue\n- If priority is ambiguous: default to \"medium\"\n- If no clear issues identified: create one issue with type \"general\" and description summarizing the message\n- If message is too vague: set confidence_score below 0.7\n- Always populate all required fields - never leave fields empty or null\n\n**EXAMPLE OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**\n```json\n{\n  \"message_id\": \"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890\",\n  \"sentiment\": \"negative\",\n  \"priority\": \"high\",\n  \"category\": \"bug_report\",\n  \"department\": \"engineering\",\n  \"confidence_score\": 0.85,\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"functionality\",\n      \"description\": \"login system failing during peak hours\",\n      \"severity\": \"high\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"keywords\": [\"login\", \"authentication\", \"downtime\", \"peak_hours\"],\n  \"customer_impact\": \"high\",\n  \"requires_immediate_attention\": true,\n  \"suggested_response_time\": \"1_hour\"\n}\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Return ONLY valid JSON - no explanatory text before or after\n- Use exact field names and value constraints specified above\n- Maintain this structured output format for all subsequent messages\n- Generate unique message_id for each analysis\n\nAnalyze the following customer message:\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe prompt separates structural requirements from analytical instructions to prevent format confusion, explicitly defines all schema constraints with valid value ranges, and includes comprehensive edge case handling to ensure no null values. The example demonstrates structure without placeholder text that could be literally copied.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\u2022 **Risk**: Complex messages may challenge the single-category constraint, potentially losing nuanced classification details\n\u2022 **Assumption**: Engineering team can handle UUID generation if the AI cannot produce truly unique identifiers consistently  \n\u2022 **Trade-off**: Strict value constraints improve database consistency but may oversimplify complex customer emotions or multi-departmental issues\n\u2022 **Dependency**: Success relies on the AI model's ability to maintain JSON format discipline across extended conversations without reverting to prose"

The `message_id`, `channel`, `sentiment`, `priority`, and `department` fields provide high-level metadata to categorize and prioritize each message. The `issues` array allows for multiple distinct topics to be extracted from a single message, with the `type` and `description` fields providing details on the nature and substance of each issue.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Handling ambiguous or multi-faceted messages: The `issues` array allows for multiple distinct topics to be extracted, which is important given that some customer feedback may cover multiple areas. However, there is a risk of over-parsing or incorrectly identifying separate issues.\n- Defining clear sentiment and priority thresholds: The `sentiment` and `priority` fields rely on discrete values, which could be challenging to determine automatically in edge cases. Providing guidance on sentiment scoring and priority criteria would be helpful.\n- Accounting for missing or incomplete information: Some customer messages may lack key details like the originating channel or the nature of the issue. The schema should accommodate null/undefined values for such cases to avoid format breaks.\n- Ensuring consistency across feedback sources: Customers may provide feedback through various channels with different conventions. The prompt should aim to produce a uniform output structure regardless of the source."

Explicitly identifying the subgroup generated by each element, as this helps students understand the relationship between element orders and subgroup structure.\n3. Summarizing the counts of elements with each possible order, to verify the identity element is included and provide an overview.\n4. Identifying all subgroups by order, and verifying that the divisors of 12 that correspond to actual subgroups are the ones given by Lagrange's theorem.\n5. Demonstrating the relationship between the order of a sum and the least common multiple of the individual orders, to illustrate a key concept in group theory.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Assumptions:\n  - Students have a basic understanding of group theory and cyclic groups.\n  - Tutors will use this table as a reference to help students verify their work and develop a deeper understanding of the concepts.\n- Risks:\n  - If the table contains any errors, it could reinforce misconceptions or lead students astray.\n  - The table may not address all potential student difficulties or questions, so additional support from tutors may be needed.\n- Trade-offs:\n  - The table provides a comprehensive analysis of Z\u2081\u2082, but it may be too detailed for some students. Tutors may need to selectively use parts of the table based on student needs.\n  - While the table demonstrates key concepts, it does not provide step-by-step explanations. Tutors will need to supplement the table with further instruction and examples."

    "response_full": "### OUTPUT\n\n**Proposed Meeting Date and Time**\nBased on the stakeholder time zones and availability constraints, the recommended meeting date and time is:\n- **Date**: Wednesday, 2 weeks from today\n- **Time**: 7:00 AM New York time (12:00 PM London, 7:00 PM Singapore, 4:00 PM San Francisco)\n\nThis timing accommodates the Singapore-based board member's business hours while also aligning with the CEO's and other key stakeholders' availability. The Board Chair in London and the General Counsel in San Francisco can both attend during their regular work hours.\n\n**Preparation Timeline**\n- 4 weeks before meeting: Finalize acquisition documents and share with CFO and General Counsel\n- 3 weeks before meeting: CFO completes financial analysis (48 hours after receiving documents)\n- 2 weeks before meeting: General Counsel finalizes legal review and discussion points\n- 1 week before meeting: CEO, Board Chair, CFO, and General Counsel review and confirm meeting agenda\n- 1 week before meeting: Meeting invitations sent to all stakeholders\n\n**Agenda Confirmation Process**\n- The CEO will work with the Board Chair to draft the initial meeting agenda, including time allocations for each topic.\n- The agenda will then be reviewed and confirmed with the CFO and General Counsel to ensure all critical items are covered.\n- Once the agenda is finalized, the meeting invitations will be sent to all stakeholders.\n\n**Meeting Duration and Structure**\n- The meeting is expected to last 2 hours, with the following structure:\n  - 30 minutes: CEO opening remarks and acquisition overview\n  - 45 minutes: CFO financial analysis presentation and Q&A\n  - 45 minutes: General Counsel legal review and discussion\n  - 30 minutes: Board discussion and decision\n\n**Communication Protocol**\n- For any last-minute availability changes from stakeholders, the executive assistant will first notify the CEO and Board Chair.\n- The Board Chair will then determine the appropriate course of action, considering stakeholder influence and time zone constraints.\n- If a critical decision-maker (CEO, Board Chair, or a majority of board members) is unable to attend, the meeting will be rescheduled.\n- All other stakeholder availability changes will be communicated to the group, and the meeting will proceed as planned if a quorum can be achieved.\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe proposed meeting date and time were selected to accommodate the stakeholder time zones while prioritizing the availability of the CEO and Board Chair, who are the most influential decision-makers. The preparation timeline ensures that the CFO and General Counsel have adequate time to complete their respective analyses and align on discussion points before the meeting.\n\nThe agenda confirmation process involves the CEO and Board Chair, who set the initial agenda, and the CFO and General Counsel, who provide input to ensure all critical topics are covered. This approach helps to align the key stakeholders before the meeting invitations are sent.\n\nThe meeting duration and structure are designed to balance the complexity of the acquisition decision with the need to respect the time of the participants. The communication protocol differentiates between critical and non-critical stakeholder availability changes, allowing the Board Chair to make informed decisions about proceeding or rescheduling the meeting.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Availability Risks**: There is a risk that one or more stakeholders may have last-minute availability changes that could disrupt the meeting. The communication protocol aims to mitigate this, but there is still a possibility that the meeting may need to be rescheduled if a critical decision-maker cannot attend.\n\n- **Time Zone Constraints**: While the proposed meeting time accommodates the majority of stakeholders, there is a trade-off in that the Singapore-based board member will be attending during their evening hours. This may impact their engagement and ability to fully participate.\n\n- **Agenda Alignment**: The agenda confirmation process relies on the CEO, Board Chair, CFO, and General Counsel to align on the meeting topics and structure. There is a risk that other board members or advisors may have additional input that could require adjustments to the agenda.\n\n- **Acquisition Decision Timeline**: The 3-week timeline for the acquisition decision is tight, and the proposed meeting date leaves little room for rescheduling if needed. This could increase pressure on the stakeholders and the decision-making process."

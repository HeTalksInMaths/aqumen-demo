# Frontend Session Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Covered in this Session
- **Refactored `App.jsx`** into composable pieces:
  - `HeaderSection` (navigation + generation controls)
  - `PipelinePanel` (reuse existing component with new blueprint support)
  - `QuestionPlayground` (interactive student view)
  - `FinalResults` and `LiveEmptyState` helpers
  - Static pipeline blueprint extracted to `pipelineBlueprint.js`
- **Added pre-generation pipeline placeholders** so Dev Mode displays all seven steps (with prompts + pending badges) before a live run.
- **Extended Playwright coverage** to assert the blueprint appears once Dev Mode is unlocked in Live mode (`shows pipeline blueprint before live generation` spec).
- **Linted the reorganized code** to ensure the new structure stays healthy.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
1. Replace the static blueprint with server-provided prompts (e.g., fetch `/api/get-prompts`), caching them client-side.
2. Run the Playwright suite locally (`npm run test:e2e`) after installing browsers with `npx playwright install`.
3. Evaluate whether the dev-mode prompt editor should save placeholders, or stay disabled until live data arrives.

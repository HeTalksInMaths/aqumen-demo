The 7-day material distribution timeline provides adequate review time for complex acquisition decisions, and the tiered communication protocol ensures efficient coordination while respecting stakeholder hierarchies.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\u2022 **Risk:** Early morning PST timing may impact General Counsel's presentation quality; mitigation includes rehearsal session and backup presenter option\n\u2022 **Assumption:** Acquisition documents will be available on schedule; delay contingency adds 48-hour buffer to entire timeline\n\u2022 **Trade-off:** Singapore time zone accommodation forces suboptimal times for West Coast participants, but their lower influence level makes this acceptable\n\u2022 **Constraint:** CEO's packed schedule limits rescheduling flexibility, making stakeholder accommodation the primary variable"

The Board Chair in London and the General Counsel in San Francisco can both attend during their regular work hours.\n\n**Preparation Timeline**\n- 4 weeks before meeting: Finalize acquisition documents and share with CFO and General Counsel\n- 3 weeks before meeting: CFO completes financial analysis (48 hours after receiving documents)\n- 2 weeks before meeting: General Counsel finalizes legal review and discussion points\n- 1 week before meeting: CEO, Board Chair, CFO, and General Counsel review and confirm meeting agenda\n- 1 week before meeting: Meeting invitations sent to all stakeholders\n\n**Agenda Confirmation Process**\n- The CEO will work with the Board Chair to draft the initial meeting agenda, including time allocations for each topic.\n- The agenda will then be reviewed and confirmed with the CFO and General Counsel to ensure all critical items are covered.\n- Once the agenda is finalized, the meeting invitations will be sent to all stakeholders.\n\n**Meeting Duration and Structure**\n- The meeting is expected to last 2 hours, with the following structure:\n  - 30 minutes: CEO opening remarks and acquisition overview\n  - 45 minutes: CFO financial analysis presentation and Q&A\n  - 45 minutes: General Counsel legal review and discussion\n  - 30 minutes: Board discussion and decision\n\n**Communication Protocol**\n- For any last-minute availability changes from stakeholders, the executive assistant will first notify the CEO and Board Chair.\n- The Board Chair will then determine the appropriate course of action, considering stakeholder influence and time zone constraints.\n- If a critical decision-maker (CEO, Board Chair, or a majority of board members) is unable to attend, the meeting will be rescheduled.\n- All other stakeholder availability changes will be communicated to the group, and the meeting will proceed as planned if a quorum can be achieved.\n\n### RATIONALE\n\nThe proposed meeting date and time were selected to accommodate the stakeholder time zones while prioritizing the availability of the CEO and Board Chair, who are the most influential decision-makers. The preparation timeline ensures that the CFO and General Counsel have adequate time to complete their respective analyses and align on discussion points before the meeting.\n\nThe agenda confirmation process involves the CEO and Board Chair, who set the initial agenda, and the CFO and General Counsel, who provide input to ensure all critical topics are covered. This approach helps to align the key stakeholders before the meeting invitations are sent.\n\nThe meeting duration and structure are designed to balance the complexity of the acquisition decision with the need to respect the time of the participants. The communication protocol differentiates between critical and non-critical stakeholder availability changes, allowing the Board Chair to make informed decisions about proceeding or rescheduling the meeting.\n\n### CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- **Availability Risks**: There is a risk that one or more stakeholders may have last-minute availability changes that could disrupt the meeting. The communication protocol aims to mitigate this, but there is still a possibility that the meeting may need to be rescheduled if a critical decision-maker cannot attend.\n\n- **Time Zone Constraints**: While the proposed meeting time accommodates the majority of stakeholders, there is a trade-off in that the Singapore-based board member will be attending during their evening hours. This may impact their engagement and ability to fully participate.\n\n- **Agenda Alignment**: The agenda confirmation process relies on the CEO, Board Chair, CFO, and General Counsel to align on the meeting topics and structure. There is a risk that other board members or advisors may have additional input that could require adjustments to the agenda.\n\n- **Acquisition Decision Timeline**: The 3-week timeline for the acquisition decision is tight, and the proposed meeting date leaves little room for rescheduling if needed. This could increase pressure on the stakeholders and the decision-making process."

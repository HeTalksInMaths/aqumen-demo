# Branch History & Recovery Documentation

## What Happened

On **October 8, 2025**, the main branch was completely overwritten with a new project ("AI Code Review Mastery game"), erasing the original Streamlit-based adversarial pipeline demo that was created on **September 12, 2025**.

## Current Branch Structure

### **main** (Current - Oct 8, 2025)
- **Commit**: `16e7063` - "Initial commit: AI Code Review Mastery game"
- **Project**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS game with hardcoded code review challenges
- **Status**: Current active project

### **hardcoded-examples**
- **Commit**: `16e7063` (Same as main)
- **Purpose**: Identical to main branch

### **original-aqumen-streamlit** ✨ (Recovered - Complete History)
- **Latest Commit**: `3d5a2c3` - Jules bot refactoring
- **Project**: Streamlit-based adversarial AI pipeline demo
- **Complete History** (5 commits from Sep 12, 2025):
  1. `a3921cb` (Sep 12, 06:27) - Initial commit: Complete Aqumen.ai Demo
  2. `f2f81a9` (Sep 12, 07:02) - Fix Streamlit deployment
  3. `10c3009` (Sep 12, 07:09) - Add AWS Bedrock integration
  4. `74d4407` (Sep 12, 07:19) - Add AWS Bedrock setup guide
  5. `3d5a2c3` (Sep 12, 08:01) - **Jules bot refactoring** (7-step pipeline, cleaner code)

### **feat/refactor-prompt-pipeline**
- **Commit**: `3d5a2c3` (Same as original-aqumen-streamlit)
- **Purpose**: Original branch that preserved the history
- **Note**: Can be deleted or kept - `original-aqumen-streamlit` is the clearer name

## Jules Bot Refactoring Analysis

The final commit `3d5a2c3` by `google-labs-jules[bot]` made **excellent improvements**:

### Changes:
- **bedrock_utils.py**: Refactored into 7-step pipeline (+172/-187 lines)
- **src/demo.jsx**: Removed 340 lines of hardcoded logic (+180/-520 lines)
- **constants.js**: Updated data structures (+79/-74 lines)

### Improvements:
✅ Better architecture (monolithic → modular 7-step pipeline)
✅ Cleaner code (removed hardcoded logic)
✅ Structured prompts with proper JSON output
✅ No features removed, just better organized
✅ More maintainable and extensible

**Verdict**: Jules' refactoring should be the starting point for any future work on this project.

## What Was Recovered

The `original-aqumen-streamlit` branch now contains:
- ✅ All original commits from September 12
- ✅ Jules bot's excellent refactoring improvements
- ✅ Complete AWS Bedrock integration
- ✅ Streamlit demo application
- ✅ Full documentation and deployment guides

## Recommendations

### If you want to continue the Streamlit project:
```bash
git checkout original-aqumen-streamlit
# Start working from Jules' improved version
```

### If you want to make it the new main:
```bash
# Backup current main
git checkout main
git checkout -b react-game-backup
git push origin react-game-backup

# Replace main with Streamlit project
git checkout main
git reset --hard original-aqumen-streamlit
git push --force origin main
```

### If you want to keep both projects separate:
- Keep `main` for the React game
- Use `original-aqumen-streamlit` for the Streamlit demo
- Both are now preserved and accessible

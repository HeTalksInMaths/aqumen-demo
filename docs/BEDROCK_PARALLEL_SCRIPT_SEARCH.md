# Bedrock Parallel Batch Script Search

## Objective
Investigate the repository (including prior commits) for any script that performs batch Amazon Bedrock invocations in parallel, distinct from the existing sequential batch runner.

## Findings
- The repository includes a sequential batch runner at `minimal/backend/run_pipeline_batch.py`. It instantiates `CorrectedSevenStepPipeline` and calls `run_batch_test(topics)` without any concurrency primitives, indicating sequential execution over the topic list.【F:minimal/backend/run_pipeline_batch.py†L1-L39】
- The supporting implementation `CorrectedSevenStepPipeline.run_batch_test` iterates through topics with a standard `for` loop and invokes `run_full_pipeline` one topic at a time, again with no evidence of parallel dispatch to Bedrock.【F:minimal/backend/corrected_7step_pipeline.py†L1207-L1218】
- A repository-wide history search (via `git log` and `git grep`) did not surface any additional scripts or modules that combine Bedrock requests with concurrency helpers such as `asyncio`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, or `Promise.all` to run batches in parallel. No file names containing "parallel" alongside Bedrock references were found in any commit.

## Conclusion
There is currently no dedicated script in the codebase—past or present—that issues batch Bedrock calls in parallel. The existing batch automation is purely sequential, so delivering parallel execution would require a new implementation (e.g., leveraging `asyncio.gather`, `concurrent.futures`, or batched Bedrock API capabilities) not present in the commit history.

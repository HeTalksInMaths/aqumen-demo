# 002 – React Dev Mode Summary V2

## Scope
Unified streaming flow so Student Mode runs also populate Dev Mode, plus improved navigation through pipeline traces.

## Enhancements
- `frontend-main-branch/src/App.jsx:268-343` — all live generations now call `fetchQuestionStreaming`, ensuring shared logs for both views.
- `App.jsx:26`, `296-312` — introduced `_id` markers and `activePipelineTab` tracking to auto-select the latest step or final assessment.
- `App.jsx:744-752` — added a Student Mode banner urging developers to review the fresh pipeline trace.
- `App.jsx:900-989` — replaced accordion UI with explicit tabs for each step and a “Final Assessment” tab.

## Workflow
1. Generate a topic from either Student or Dev Mode (both hit the streaming endpoint).
2. Student Mode displays the final question immediately.
3. Switch to Dev Mode to inspect steps via tab buttons; metadata reveals differentiation status, attempts, and weak-model failures.

## Follow-up ideas
- Allow comparison of multiple runs in Dev Mode via saved sessions.
- Surface per-step timing metrics to highlight slow or failing stages.

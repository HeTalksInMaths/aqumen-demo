# 001 – React Dev Mode Summary

## Scope
Initial Dev Mode integration in the React frontend so developers can inspect the 7‑step pipeline without leaving the UI.

## Key changes
- `frontend-main-branch/src/App.jsx:19` — added `viewMode` state to toggle Student vs Dev panels.
- `App.jsx:268-343` — switched Dev Mode generation to use `fetchQuestionStreaming`, capture step data, and reset UI state.
- `App.jsx:900-989` — rendered streamed steps (with expandable detail) and surfaced final assessment metadata.
- `frontend-main-branch/src/api.js:55-117` — introduced optional-callback safety and returned raw final-event metadata to the UI.

## Usage
1. Run FastAPI locally, then start the React app (`npm run dev`).
2. Choose **Dev Mode (Streaming)**, enter a topic, and click **Generate**.
3. Watch each pipeline step appear with full LLM responses; switch back to Student Mode to play the same question.

## Next considerations
- Decide whether to retire the Streamlit debugger or keep it for deeper analyses.
- Persist streamed runs to compare multiple generations without reloading.

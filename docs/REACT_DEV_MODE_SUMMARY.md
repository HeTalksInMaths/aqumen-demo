# Unified React Dev Mode Summary

## What changed
1. **Student/Developer toggle**  
   - `frontend-main-branch/src/App.jsx:19`, `724-744`  
   - new `viewMode` state switches between playable student view and the new developer panel.

2. **SSE streaming in React**  
   - `App.jsx:268-343`  
   - Live generation now calls `fetchQuestionStreaming` in dev mode, records each streamed step, and cleans up the EventSource on completion or error.

3. **Pipeline debugger panel**  
   - `App.jsx:900-989`  
   - Dev mode renders streamed steps (`details` accordions with full LLM responses) plus metadata for the final assessment so you can debug and immediately play the generated question.

4. **API helper tweaks**  
   - `frontend-main-branch/src/api.js:55-117`  
   - Optional chaining prevents callback errors, and the final SSE event now returns both the parsed question and the raw metadata for the dev panel.  

## How to use it
1. Run the React app as usual (`npm run dev`) with FastAPI running.
2. Switch the **View** control to “Dev Mode (Streaming)”.
3. Select **Live Generation**, enter a topic, and click *Generate*.
4. Watch the pipeline steps populate in real time; once complete, toggle back to Student Mode to play the newly generated question.  

## Follow-up ideas
- Keep the Streamlit debugger for deep-dive comparisons or retire it if the React panel covers your workflow.
- Persist streamed runs so multiple generations can be compared without leaving the page.

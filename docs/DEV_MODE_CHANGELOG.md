# React Dev/Student Integration Changelog

## 1. Unified streaming (2025‑10‑09)
- All live generations, regardless of Student or Dev view, now hit `/api/generate-stream`.  
  Shared state captures step logs and the final assessment.  
  Code: `frontend-main-branch/src/App.jsx:268-343`

- Added a Student Mode banner to highlight when fresh pipeline data exists.  
  Code: `App.jsx:744-752`

## 2. Developer panel overhaul (2025‑10‑09)
- Introduced `_id` markers and `activePipelineTab` state so the most recent step is auto-selected and “Final Assessment” appears when the stream completes.  
  Code: `App.jsx:26`, `App.jsx:296-312`, `App.jsx:900-989`

- Replaced collapsible panels with explicit tab buttons for each step plus a final tab.  
  Code: `App.jsx:934-989`

## 3. Code readability improvements (2025‑10‑09)
- Preserved indentation in the clickable code block by enforcing `whiteSpace: 'pre'` across spans.  
  Code: `App.jsx:398`

## 4. Playwright setup for UI snapshots (2025‑10‑09)
- Added `@playwright/test` with a web-server-aware configuration so e2e runs can spin up Vite, visit both Student/Dev views, and capture screenshots for Claude Code reviews.  
  Code: `frontend-main-branch/package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/dev-student-screenshots.spec.ts`

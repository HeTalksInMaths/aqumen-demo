# Code Testing Overview

This directory consolidates backend and frontend test harnesses along with guidance for running them. Each subfolder documents the chosen framework, key scenarios covered, and relevant configuration files.

- `backend/` – Pytest-based suite validating critical data persistence behaviors in the Python backend.
- `frontend/` – Node.js test-runner suite exercising API adapters and data transformations in the React frontend.
- `TEST_REPORT.md` – Captured output from the latest automated test execution.

Refer to the subdirectories for per-stack setup and execution details.

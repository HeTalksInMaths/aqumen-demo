# Branch Cleanup Analysis - October 16, 2025

## Executive Summary

The repository has **24 remote branches** that need review and potential cleanup. Based on the issue request and BRANCH_HISTORY.md, the "minimal" branch is referenced as "now the main branch" and we need to determine which branches still need to merge.

## Current Main Branch Status

**Branch:** `main`
**Latest Commit:** `9323692` - "Merge pull request #4 from HeTalksInMaths/add-claude-github-actions-1760339852958"
**Project:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS (AI Code Review Mastery game)

## Critical Question: What is "minimal" branch?

The issue states: *"Figure out which repos still need to merge to minimal branch which is now the main branch"*

**This suggests:**
- The "minimal" branch (`b7a18d4`) was intended to become the new main branch
- However, the current `main` branch is at commit `9323692`
- These are different commits, suggesting either:
  1. The minimal branch content was already merged to main, OR
  2. The minimal branch still needs to be merged, OR
  3. There's confusion about which branch should be the "main"

**RECOMMENDATION:** Need to compare `minimal` branch with current `main` to determine:
- Are they based on the same project (React game vs Streamlit demo)?
- Does minimal contain changes not in main?
- Should minimal be merged, or is it obsolete?

## Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Understand "minimal" Branch Relationship ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY

```bash
# Fetch the minimal branch locally
git fetch origin minimal:minimal

# Compare with main
git log minimal..main --oneline
git log main..minimal --oneline

# Check file differences
git diff minimal main --stat
```

**Decision points:**
- If minimal is ahead of main with valuable changes ‚Üí Merge minimal to main
- If minimal is behind main ‚Üí Delete minimal
- If they diverged ‚Üí Determine which is the "true" main

### Phase 2: Review Feature Branches for Valuable Work

For each feature branch, check:
```bash
# Is it merged?
git log main..origin/feature/branch-name --oneline

# If it has commits not in main, review them
git diff main...origin/feature/branch-name --stat
```

**Branches to prioritize:**
1. `feature/automate-dataset-creation` - May have automation tooling
2. `feature/batch-pipeline-improvements` - May have performance improvements
3. `refactor-backend-pipeline` - May have architectural improvements
4. `feat/question-playground-revamp` - May have UI enhancements

### Phase 3: Clean Up Automated Codex Branches

All `codex/*` branches appear to be automated task branches. Unless they contain critical fixes:

```bash
# Delete all codex branches (11 total)
git push origin --delete codex/analyze-button-functionality-in-recent-commits
git push origin --delete codex/analyze-button-functionality-in-recent-commits-gfxqos
# ... etc for all 11 branches
```

### Phase 4: Remove Duplicate Branches

```bash
# Keep original-aqumen-streamlit, delete the duplicate
git push origin --delete feat/refactor-prompt-pipeline

# If automate-dataset-creation and automate-dataset-creation-2 are identical
git push origin --delete feature/automate-dataset-creation-2
```

### Phase 5: Review and Merge or Delete Fix Branches

For each fix branch:
1. Check if the fix is already in main
2. If not, cherry-pick or merge the fix
3. Delete the branch after merging

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Actions

1. **Clarify minimal branch intent** - Compare with main and determine relationship
2. **Review feature branches** - Check for unmerged valuable work
3. **Delete codex branches** - Clean up automated task branches (11 branches)
4. **Delete duplicates** - Remove feat/refactor-prompt-pipeline (1 branch)

### Expected Cleanup Results

- **Keep (6 branches):**
  - `main` - Current active development
  - `original-aqumen-streamlit` - Preserved historical project
  - `hardcoded-examples` - May have reference value
  - Feature branches with unmerged work (TBD after review)

- **Delete (~18 branches):**
  - 11 codex/* branches (automated tasks)
  - 1 duplicate (feat/refactor-prompt-pipeline)
  - Minimal branches if obsolete (3 branches)
  - Feature/fix branches after merging or confirming abandonment (~3 branches)

## Questions for Repository Owner

1. **What is the minimal branch?**
   - Is it the source of truth that should replace main?
   - Or is it an old experiment that can be deleted?

2. **Feature branches priorities:**
   - Are any of the feature/* branches still being worked on?
   - Should we merge them, or are they abandoned?

3. **Project direction:**
   - Is the React game (current main) the active project?
   - Or should we restore the Streamlit demo from original-aqumen-streamlit?

## Next Steps

After clarification on the "minimal" branch:
1. Create detailed diff analysis for minimal vs main
2. Generate merge/delete commands for each branch
3. Execute cleanup in safe order (merge first, then delete)
4. Update BRANCH_HISTORY.md with cleanup results
